How to build nice embedded app for web

ROOT ELEMENT

Html elements of your app can inherit some styles from host site. You should use `all: initial` rule to avoid it.
#your-root-selector {
 Â all: inherit;
}


DEPRECATED TAGS

They are:

h1, h2, h3...
a,
p,
i,
button,
ul, li.

Avoid these tags if you can. Because developers of host sites like to use css selectors by them with no classes:
a {...}
p {...}
Css rules like above can add some styles to your elements.


APPROVED TAGS

Instead use tags:

div - for block and flexbox elements

span - for inline elements

These tags usually are styled via classes and indexes. Therefore chances to get conflict with css are very low.


TAGS REPLACEMENT

h1, h2..., i - span

a - span or div. Depends on you need either inline or block element. Moving to another page (url in href) can be implemented via java script code.

p, button, ul, li - use div tag.


UNIQUE CLASSES

Avoid regular class names like `panel`, `item`, `input` etc. Your class names should be really unique. There're few ways to get them:

- Write prefixes manually. Something like `someprefix-panel` or `sp-panel`.

- Use `css-in-js` packages. There`re a lot of them https://github.com/MicheleBertoli/css-in-js. Some of them (like `glamor` and `aphrodite`) creates really unique class names for you.

- Use npm packages like `bem-cn` and `bem-cn-dashed-style`. They help you to define class name prefix and add prefix to class names automatically.
